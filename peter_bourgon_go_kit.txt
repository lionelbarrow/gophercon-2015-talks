Go Kit: A Standard Library for Distributed Systems
-----

Peter Bourgon, GopherCon 2015

Modern enterprise is:
* Tech-oriented
* Consumer-focused
* Successful - growing fast
* 50-1000 engineers
* Microservice architecture

Enterprises:
* Google -- too big
* Amazon -- too big
* Twitter
* Netflix
* Spotify
* SoundCloud
* Etsy
* (Braintree)

These enterprises can take risks on technology; technological wins are also
business wins. These are ideal businesses for Go, but adoption in them hasn't
been great.

So what's missing? Maturity, sure, but also library support. Modern
enterprises need a set of tools and abstractions. So, enter Go Kit. Very
similar to Ribbon (Twitter) or Finagle (Netflix).

Goal of Go Kit is to make Go a first-class citizen at the application layer.

Built on RPC. Go kits domain: transport, service metrics, service safety,
service connectivity. Your domain: biz analytics, biz metrics, biz logic.

Components:
* An endpoint interface
* Logging API that _mandates_ structured logging
* Metrics, with the help of Coda Hale!
* Rate limiting middleware
* Circuit breaking middleware -- if all requests are failing to downstream
  service, stop sending requests!
* Load balance and service discovery
* Tracing

Example - addsvc, a service that just adds numbers.
